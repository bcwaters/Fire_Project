Temperatures across much of the West lower a little to around normal to slightly above normal as an upper trough establishes over the West. Winds ease across the Pacific Northwest but still remain breezy, with generally westerly winds of 10- 20 mph and gust s of 25 -35 mph amid minimum RH of 10- 20% away from the coast focused on the east slopes of the Cascades into the Columbia Basin, and modest overnight recovery.   Across the Great Basin and into the Central Rockies, winds remain breezy, especially across the eastern Basin and into the Rockies, with west to southwesterly winds 10- 20 mph with gusts of 20 -45 mph amid RH of 7 -15% and poor overnight recovery â€“ widespread elevated conditions are expected for these parts. For most of California away from the coast, temperatures lower a little, however low RH continues with RH of 7 -20% and poor overnight recovery. Winds will be mostly light except in areas favored by terrain. 

Monsoon moisture lies over much of Arizona and into New Mexico and the central Rockies, with some upper moisture moving into the Great Basin area. This will maintain a chance of isolated mixed wet/dry thunderstorms with gusty outflows across the Southwest,  as well as parts of the Great Basin and around the Central Rockies, with lightning more likely over these parts than during previous days - isolated dry thunderstorms and new ignitions remain possible on the western/northern fringe of the thunderstorms. E lsewhere, breezy/dry southerly winds are expected across the southern Plains. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected across much of the east, south, and Great Plains.
